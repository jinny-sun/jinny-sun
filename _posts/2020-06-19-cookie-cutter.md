description: I am currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science. I finished my PhD from the Joint UC Berkeley – UC San Francisco Graduate Program in Bioengineering in 2020. For my dissertation, I applied signal processing, image processing and machine learning methods to biomedical applications in metabolomics and transcriptomics field. I also performed kinetic modeling of time-series data to predict therapeutic response in prostate and renal cancer. I love working on unsolved challenges, and previously worked on one of Google X's moonshot projects. I am excited to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to solve new challenges in data science.

Do you love baking cookies? Have you ever used a recipe that didn't include important nutritional information, such as the calories per cookie? CookieCutter is a web app that predicts the calories per cookie of a given recipe. It also provides personalized portion control suggestions to help you meet your caloric needs.

This app was created during my fellowship at [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/). More details on the [web app](cookie-cutter.xyz) can be found in these [presentation slides](https://tinyurl.com/cookie-cutter) 

## How does CookieCutter work?
CookieCutter uses **bag of words** vectorization to convert ingredient lists into numerical predictors that are fed into a pretrained Gradient Boosting Regressor to estimate how many calories are in each cookie. The algorithm represents each recipe as a high-dimensional vector of ingredient names and the amount of ingredient required for the recipe.

## Text processing

Here is an example recipe.

| Recipe Name | Ingredients | Number of Servings | Calories per Serving |
| :---------- |:----------- | :----------------: | :------------------: |
| Best cookie recipe | ¾ cup White Sugar, granulated | 12 | 214.3 |
|   | 8 ounces Butter (softened) |
|   | 2 ½ cups All-purpose Flour
|   | 1 teaspoon Baking Soda |

The ingredients strings are pre-processed using RegEx and NLTK library. This includes:
- Converting unicode characters to strings
- Separating numeric values from text
- Removing plurals, punctuation, hypenated words, anything in parentheses, whitespace, and stopwords

## NLP
After the ingredient strings was processed, part-of-speech tagging was used to select for nouns to remove unnecessary words. The 20 most frequent bigrams (where the first token was an adjective or noun, and second token was a noun) were also included in the analysis. The number of features was then reduced from 372 to 79 using frequency-based feature selection to only include tokens that appeared in at least 10 recipes. Ingredients were then vectorized using bag of words. Since higher frequencies of an ingredient token should correlate with the predictor variable (calories), bag of words is preferred over TF-IDF, which gives lower weight to tokens that appear more frequently.

## Model Validation

Several regression models were assessed, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. 

| Model | Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) |
| :---- |:---------------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Linear Regression | 0.79 | 52 |
| Random Forest | 0.82 | 50 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.86 | 43 |
| XGBoost | 0.86 | 43 |

The linear regression performed the worst, most likely due to the large number of features, and inaccurately assigned the largest coefficients, which tells the model the amount of calories per gram of ingredient, to irrelevant features. For example, the largest coefficient was assigned to salt. 

All tree-based methods accurately identified the most important features contributing to calories, such as sugar, chocolate, and flour. Boosting models performed better than the random forest. While gradient boosting and XGBoost had similar performance metrics based on R<sup>2</sup>, gradient boosting was ultimately chosen as the preferred model since XGBoost had a larger over-estimation of the calories of an individual ingredient. 

| 1 cup (ingredient) | True Calories | Predicted<br>(Lin. Reg.) | Predicted<br>(Random Forest) | Predicted<br>(Gradient Boosting) | Predicted<br>(XGBoost) |
| :---- |:-----------: | :---------------: |:----------------: |:----------------: |:----------------: |
| Sugar | 773 | 2,078 | 2,426 | 1,826 | 2,324 |
| Flour | 445 | 1,730 | 2,478 | 1,777 | 1,955 |
| Chocolate | 805 | 2,260 | 3,287 | 2,652 | 2,971 |
| Salt | 0 | 33,303 | 3,567 | 3,637 | 2,755 |

## Future Directions
The work presented in this post was accomplished in a short sprint (3 weeks). Given more time and resources, I would prioritize three main improvements. 

1) Model Improvements
    One drawback of using n-grams and part-of-speech tagging for tokenization is that it cannot differentiate between different categories of nouns. To address this, a manual list of unnecessary nouns was curated in order to create a minimal viable product. The ideal way to tokenize the ingredients is to use Word2Vec, which would be able to differentiate between ingredients and other unnecessary words and is capable of integrating rare or new ingredients using inference based on the values of related words or nearby vectors using cosine similiarity. 
    
2) Engineering improvements
  To improve the user interface of the web app, I would enable URL input with real-time web scraping. Currently the input of ingredients must be semicolon-separated, which makes the user interaction more cumbersome. This is because the Streamlit app automatically removes whitespace, symbols, and other types of characters. Below is an example of a list of ingredients that is difficult to parse using RegEx since the input string can contain commas, parenthesis, and non-essential numerical values.

| 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 bars chocolate, chopped into 1/2 inch cubes |
|:-----|

3) Data enhancements:
  While feature engineering greatly improved model performance due to the small dataset (2.2k recipes), the removal of rare ingredients reduces the useability of the app. Curating more data will allow for more features to be included and also expand the model to other types of recipes and cuisines. Furthermore, a BERT model could be used to categorize recipes based on the type of cuisine. This is useful since cookie recipes may require a different model for calorie prediction than other types of recipes.
