### EXPERIENCE

**Data Science Fellow**, Insight Data Science, San Francisco, CA                           	         	   May 2020 - Present

- Built a Streamlit web app that predicts the calories per serving of a given recipe based on the ingredients list to help consumers eat healthier.
- Optimized model performance from 59% to 86% R2 using natural language processing and gradient boosting regression in Python.
- github.com/jinny-sun/cookie-cutter | cookie-cutter.xyz

2014-2020 –– **Graduate Student Researcher**, UCSF, San Francisco, CA

- Predicted therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer using kinetic modeling of times series data to quantify metabolic pathway fluxes and logistic regression with 85% accuracy in MATLAB.
- Classified tumor aggressiveness using k-Nearest Neighbors with 69% accuracy by normalizing metabolic features and tuning hyperparameters in R. 
- Identified key metabolic biomarkers of two aggressive prostate cancer subtypes using Principal Components Analysis on spectroscopic data in R.
- Created automated spectroscopic and image processing pipelines of MRI data in MATLAB.

2014 –– **Research Associate**, Google[x], Mountain View, CA
- Prototyped nanodiagnostic device to detect circulating tumor cells using magnetic nanoparticles.
- Simulated behavior of magnetic nanoparticles using nonlinear regression models in MATLAB. Resulted in a 4-fold boost in the performance of the device.
