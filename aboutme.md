title: About me
subtitle: Insight Data Science fellow, Bioengineering PhD
description: I am currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science. I finished my PhD from the Joint UC Berkeley – UC San Francisco Graduate Program in Bioengineering in 2020. For my dissertation, I applied signal processing, image processing and machine learning methods to biomedical applications in metabolomics and transcriptomics field. I also performed kinetic modeling of time-series data to predict therapeutic response in prostate and renal cancer. I love working on unsolved challenges, and previously worked on one of Google X's moonshot projects. I am excited to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to solve new challenges in data science.
