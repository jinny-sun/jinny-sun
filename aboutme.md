![Profile Picture](/assets/img/headshot2.jpg)

I am a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science. In March 2020, I finished my Bioengineering PhD from the Joint UC Berkeley â€“ UC San Francisco Graduate Program. For my dissertation, I applied signal processing and machine learning methods to biomedical applications. Specifically, I used metabolomics, transcriptomics, and kinetic modeling of time-series data to predict therapeutic response in prostate and renal cancer. I am excited to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to solve new challenges in data science.
